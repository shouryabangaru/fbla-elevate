💻 Prompt for Replit AI
You are an expert React and UI/UX designer. Please redesign this Roleplay Event selection page to be highly visual and attractive to high school FBLA students.

🎯 Goals
Make each event card stand out beautifully, inviting students to click.

Use modern gradients, shadows, icons, and hover effects.

Ensure readability, strong visual hierarchy, and brand consistency.

✨ Requirements
1️⃣ Overall Layout

Use a dark gradient background (midnight blue to black) for depth.

Keep the header at the top, but reduce empty spacing above the cards.

Add a motivational tagline below “Choose Your Event” like:

“Master real FBLA roleplay scenarios and prepare to win.”

2️⃣ Event Cards

Design each event card as follows:

Rounded corners with subtle gold or neon blue glow on hover.

A large, vivid icon at the top, tailored to the event (placeholder icons for now).

Event name in bold white text.

Number of scenarios in small gold or light gray text.

A short, clear description in light gray text for readability.

Spacing & Alignment

Increase spacing between cards for breathing room.

Use grid layout with 3 cards per row on desktop, responsive to 1 per row on mobile.

Hover Effects

Slight scale up (1.05) on hover.

Glow effect in gold or blue behind the card when hovered.

Buttons

Remove duplicate buttons if not needed, or redesign as a single clean CTA button per card with:

Gold (#FFD700) background

Rounded pill shape

Bold black text

3️⃣ Typography

Use large bold sans-serif fonts for titles.

Keep consistent font family and weights.

4️⃣ Icons

Replace current generic icons with unique icons per event category, e.g.:

💰 Banking & Financial Systems → Dollar or Bank icon

📈 Business Management → Graph or Chart icon

💼 Customer Service → Headset icon

🚀 Entrepreneurship → Rocket icon

🏨 Hospitality & Event Management → Hotel icon

🌐 International Business → Globe icon

Use bright gradient or gold icons with a slight glow to match brand aesthetic.

5️⃣ Animations

Add fade-in animations for cards as the page loads for dynamic entrance.

Subtle hover animations on icons (e.g. bounce or pulse).

6️⃣ Design System

Brand Colors:

Black (#000000) for deep backgrounds

Midnight Blue (#003366) for sections

Gold (#FFD700) for buttons and highlights

White (#FFFFFF) for text

Light Gray (#CCCCCC) for descriptions

7️⃣ Accessibility

Ensure high contrast for all text.

Buttons and icons must be keyboard accessible and readable by screen readers.

8️⃣ Code Structure

Use React functional components with clear naming:

RoleplayPage

EventCard

Use CSS Modules or standard CSS (no Tailwind).

Ensure responsiveness on all devices.
