You are an expert full-stack developer building an FBLA preparation web app called FBLA Elevate using React and Firebase.

**Goal:** Build a professional, clean, responsive homepage with Firebase authentication.

**Requirements:**

1. **Framework:** React (functional components)  
2. **Design:**
   - Use a blue (#003366), yellow (#FFD700), and white (#FFFFFF) color scheme.
   - Modern, bold typography for headings.
   - Clean navbar with links: Home, Practice Questions, Flashcards, Presentation Tips, Leaderboard, Achievements, About Us.
   - Add a hero section with:
     - FBLA Elevate logo or placeholder icon
     - Headline: "FBLA Elevate"
     - Subheadline: "Your hub for preparing for FBLA competitive events!"
     - CTA button: "Start Practicing" (yellow with hover effect)

3. **Authentication (Firebase):**
   - Integrate Firebase Auth.
   - Create a signup and login page with email/password and Google login options.
   - Upon user signup, save user details (uid, name, email, schoolID) to Firestore in a 'users' collection.
   - Create a dropdown menu during signup for users to select their school (placeholder options for now).

4. **Database setup (Firestore):**
   - Create collections for users, questions, flashcards, leaderboard, and achievements.
   - For this task, create a sample 'flashcards' collection with:
     - eventID
     - term
     - definition
   - Create a Flashcards page that:
     - Fetches flashcards from Firestore by eventID.
     - Displays term and definition with next/previous buttons.

5. **Leaderboard (future steps):**
   - Placeholder leaderboard page for now with sample data.
   - Heading: “Leaderboard” and dummy user rankings.

6. **Achievements (future steps):**
   - Placeholder achievements page with badge icons and sample achievement names.

**Notes:**
- Write clean, well-commented code.  
- Structure with components: Navbar, HomePage, LoginPage, SignupPage, FlashcardsPage, LeaderboardPage, AchievementsPage.  
- Use CSS Modules or standard CSS (no Tailwind).  
- Ensure the site is responsive for mobile and desktop.

Generate the full React code, including:
- Firebase config initialization (placeholder config variables)  
- App.js routing setup using React Router  
- Individual components as described  
- Basic CSS styling for a professional look

**Objective:** This will be the MVP for FBLA Elevate to present in my NC FBLA VP campaign, so it should look clean and functional.
