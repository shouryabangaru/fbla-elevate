You are an expert React and Firebase developer. Please build a **Roleplay Practice Tab** for my FBLA Elevate web app.

**Goal:** Allow users to select their roleplay event, view sample prompts, get guidance on how to approach them, and practice with a built-in timer.

**Requirements:**

1️⃣ **Event Selector**
- At the top, create a **dropdown menu** or side menu listing these roleplay events:
  - Banking & Financial Systems
  - Business Management
  - Customer Service
  - Entrepreneurship
  - Hospitality & Event Management
  - International Business
  - Management Information Systems
  - Marketing
  - Network Design
  - Parliamentary Procedure
  - Sports & Entertainment Management
  - Technology Support & Services
- When a user selects an event, load **3–5 sample prompts** for that event.

---

2️⃣ **Prompt Display**
- Below the event selector, show:
  - The selected **prompt text** in a styled card or container.
  - A “How to Approach This Prompt” section with bullet-pointed advice.
  - Example structure: 
    - Identify the main issue
    - Define 2–3 clear solutions or strategies
    - Address risks
    - Close with a strong conclusion

- Use **placeholder sample prompts** for now.

---

3️⃣ **Practice Timer**
- Add a **10-minute countdown timer** at the top or side of the prompt.
- Start/Stop/Reset buttons.
- Timer starts at 10:00, counts down in MM:SS.
- When the timer hits zero, display a message: *“Time’s up! Practice your delivery!”*

---

4️⃣ **Navigation**
- Add **Next Prompt** and **Previous Prompt** buttons to cycle through the sample prompts for each event.
- Add a **Back to Events** button to return to the selector.

---

5️⃣ **Design**
- Use FBLA Elevate brand colors:
  - Black (#000000) for the background or headers
  - Blue (#003366) for sections and text accents
  - Yellow (#FFD700) for buttons and highlights
  - White (#FFFFFF) for text

- Make the prompt card visually appealing:
  - Rounded corners
  - Drop shadow for depth
  - Large readable font

- Make the timer large and clear.

---

6️⃣ **Future Integration (Comment in Code)**
- Add TODO comments for connecting to Firebase later:
  - Store user practice history (event, prompt, date)
  - Option to upload or record practice video/audio
  - Community prompt submissions

---

7️⃣ **Tech Stack**
- Use **React functional components**.
- Use **standard CSS** or CSS Modules (no Tailwind).
- Organize into components: 
  - RoleplayTab (main container)
  - EventSelector
  - PromptCard
  - Timer
  - NavigationButtons

- Use placeholder JSON for prompts:
  ```js
  const roleplayPrompts = {
    "Banking & Financial Systems": [
      {
        prompt: "You are a bank branch manager tasked with increasing new account sign-ups by 20% this quarter.",
        guidance: [
          "Identify current weaknesses",
          "Propose 2 marketing strategies",
          "Discuss risk management"
        ]
      },
      // Add more prompts here
    ],
    ...
  };
