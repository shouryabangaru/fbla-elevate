I’m experiencing two critical issues with the roleplay data rendering. Please help me fix both in a clean and bug-free way.

🔧 CONTEXT:
I have a list of 15 custom roleplay prompts per event, each with its own:
- Background Information
- Scenario
- Objectives

I’ve stored this data as an array of objects (one for each prompt). Each prompt should render its own **unique** values when selected.

🪲 BUG 1: Background and Scenario are the Same

🎯 PROBLEM:
When the component renders a roleplay, the `background` and `scenario` are identical — even though they are different in the data I entered.

✅ EXPECTED FIX:
Check the `roleplayData` array to make sure each prompt has **distinct keys**:
```js
{
  background: "...", // this is the context
  scenario: "...",   // this is the prompt situation
  objectives: [ ... ] // bullet list
}
Update the render logic so the UI shows the correct content:

background should be shown in the Background Information section

scenario should be shown in the Scenario section

Use only the values from the specific prompt being passed/rendered.

🪲 BUG 2: Objectives Are Always the Same

🎯 PROBLEM:
All 15 roleplays are showing the same objectives, even though I entered unique ones per prompt.

✅ EXPECTED FIX:
Make sure the UI dynamically pulls objectives from the current roleplayObject, not from a global or static array. For example:

js
Copy
Edit
<ul>
  {roleplay.objectives.map((obj, i) => (
    <li key={i}>• {obj}</li>
  ))}
</ul>
Check the logic where roleplay is selected (e.g., from an index or ID), and ensure it's pointing to the correct prompt object in the array.

🧠 TIP:
Make sure that:

Each prompt has its own object in the roleplayData array.

You're not accidentally copying the same values when importing or generating the component.

When a user clicks on a roleplay prompt (e.g., Scenario 3), you're passing the correct object into the component.

✅ Bonus: If using state, confirm you update currentPromptIndex (or similar) correctly so it fetches the specific roleplay from the array:

js
Copy
Edit
const currentRoleplay = roleplayData[currentPromptIndex];
Please rewrite the logic so:

Each prompt’s content is pulled from its correct object.

Nothing is reused or hardcoded.

It works perfectly for 15 unique prompts.

Let me know if you'd like a working React component sample to fully debug this.
