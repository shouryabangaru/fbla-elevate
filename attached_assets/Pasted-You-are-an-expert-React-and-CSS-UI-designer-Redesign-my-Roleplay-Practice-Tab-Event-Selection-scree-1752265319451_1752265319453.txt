You are an expert React and CSS UI designer. Redesign my Roleplay Practice Tab Event Selection screen to be extremely visually appealing, modern, and interactive.

Current issues (fix these):

The boxes look too flat and generic.

The layout feels empty with insufficient contrast and depth.

Icons and text lack dynamic visual hierarchy.

✅ Goals for this redesign:
🔲 1. Card Design

Make each event box look like an interactive card:

Use rounded corners (radius 12–16px).

Add a subtle gradient background (dark blue → black) or a glassmorphism effect for modern style.

Include a strong drop shadow for depth (e.g. rgba(0,0,0,0.5) with 10px blur and 5px offset).

On hover:

Slight scale-up animation (transform: scale(1.05)).

Add a glowing border in FBLA yellow (#FFD700) or a glowing shadow effect.

🔲 2. Icons

Make icons larger and bolder with a slight glow or gradient overlay for vibrancy.

Center icons vertically and horizontally within the card.

🔲 3. Text Styling

Event name: Bold, larger font size (1.2–1.4rem) with white (#FFFFFF).

Subtext (e.g. “15 prompts”): Smaller, muted grey (#CCCCCC).

🔲 4. Layout

Use a responsive grid layout:

3 cards per row on desktop.

2 cards per row on tablet.

1 card per row on mobile.

Center the entire grid horizontally.

🔲 5. Background

Change the page background to:

A dark gradient (top: #000000, bottom: #003366) or

A subtle abstract blue-black background pattern for depth.

🔲 6. Section Title

"Choose Your Event" should:

Be large (2rem or bigger), bold, and centered.

Use FBLA yellow (#FFD700) with a subtle shadow for readability.

Add a thin underline or separator line below for visual structure.

🔲 7. Transitions

Add smooth transitions (200–300ms) for hover and click interactions for a premium feel.

🔲 8. Accessibility

Ensure high color contrast for readability.

Cursor should change to pointer on hover over each card.

💻 Implementation Notes
Use React functional components and standard CSS or CSS modules.

Organize cards in a RoleplayEventCard component with props (icon, title, promptCount).

Use flexbox or CSS grid for clean alignment and responsiveness.
