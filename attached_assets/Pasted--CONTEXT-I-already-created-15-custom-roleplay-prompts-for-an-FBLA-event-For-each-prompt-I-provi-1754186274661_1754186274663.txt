🧠 CONTEXT:
I already created 15 custom roleplay prompts for an FBLA event. For each prompt, I provided:

- An exact **Background Information**
- A unique **Scenario**
- 3–5 detailed **Objectives**

All of these were custom-written and must appear **exactly as I wrote them**.

---

❌ CURRENT ISSUE:
While the system now differentiates the content per prompt, the rendered data does **not exactly match what I originally inputted**. Some words are changed, phrasing is off, and it doesn’t reflect my actual content.

✅ GOAL:
I want to make sure the app uses **my original prompt data word-for-word** with **no AI rephrasing, rewriting, summarizing, or optimization**.

---

✅ SOLUTION:
1. **Update the data source:**
   - Use a clean `roleplayPrompts` array of 15 objects, each like this:
   ```js
   {
     background: "My exact background information for prompt #1",
     scenario: "My exact scenario for prompt #1",
     objectives: [
       "My exact objective 1",
       "My exact objective 2",
       "My exact objective 3"
     ]
   }
These strings should be copy-pasted from my original input, with no changes.

Render logic:

When a user selects a prompt (e.g. “Prompt #5”), fetch the corresponding object from the array without editing the content.

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
const prompt = roleplayPrompts[selectedIndex];
Display logic:

Show the background in the Background Information section exactly as entered.

Show the scenario in the Scenario section exactly as entered.

Map over objectives to display each bullet point exactly as entered.

No formatting changes:

Do not shorten, restructure, or improve grammar.

Preserve capitalization, line breaks, dashes, and everything else from my input.

💡 EXTRA:
If my input was copy-pasted into a file or raw array before, recheck that no extra whitespace, quote formatting, or auto-fixes (e.g., autocorrect) were applied. The current bug may stem from incorrectly parsed or reformatted prompt data.

Once this is done, every user should see the exact same language I wrote — per prompt — across background, scenario, and objectives.

Let me know if you'd like me to regenerate a clean JSON array based on your 15 original inputs for the dev to plug directly into the app.
