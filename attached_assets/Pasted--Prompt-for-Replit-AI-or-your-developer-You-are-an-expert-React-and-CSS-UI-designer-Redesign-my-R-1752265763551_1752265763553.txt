You are an expert React and CSS UI designer. Redesign my Roleplay Practice Tab Event Selection screen to be professional, modern, and highly visually appealing.

✅ Current Issues (fix these):
The cards are too narrow and cramped.

Text overflows or wraps awkwardly (e.g. Business Management).

The icon glow and card shadows look unrefined.

Overall layout lacks spacing, padding, and balance.

Section header overlaps with navbar when scrolling.

🎯 Goals for Redesign:
🔲 1. Card Design

Increase card width to better fit event titles without awkward wraps.

Maintain consistent height and width ratios.

Use rounded corners (radius: 16px) for a softer, modern look.

Add a smooth drop shadow (e.g. rgba(0,0,0,0.6), 10px blur, 5px offset) for depth.

Apply a subtle dark gradient background within each card (e.g. #001122 to #000000) for premium feel.

On hover:

Scale up card slightly (transform: scale(1.05)).

Add a glowing border in FBLA yellow (#FFD700) with smooth transition.

🔲 2. Icon Styling

Increase icon size for prominence.

Use a slight glowing effect or gradient overlay for vibrancy.

Center icons horizontally with 20–30px top margin.

🔲 3. Text Styling

Event name:

Use larger font (1.3–1.5rem), bold, and white (#FFFFFF).

Centered horizontally with good line-height spacing to avoid cramped look.

Subtext (e.g. “15 prompts”):

Smaller (0.9rem), muted grey (#CCCCCC), with top margin for spacing.

🔲 4. Layout

Switch to a responsive grid layout:

Desktop: 3 cards per row

Tablet: 2 cards per row

Mobile: 1 card per row

Add sufficient horizontal and vertical spacing (gap: 20–30px) between cards.

Ensure padding within each card (20px minimum) for breathing space.

🔲 5. Section Title Styling

"Choose Your Event" should:

Be large (2rem or bigger), bold, and centered.

Use FBLA yellow (#FFD700) with subtle text shadow for contrast on dark background.

Add a thin underline or gold separator bar below for visual structure.

Add top margin (40–60px) so it does not overlap with navbar.

🔲 6. Background

Use a clean dark gradient background for the page (top: #000000, bottom: #003366).

Optionally add a subtle abstract or blurred pattern for depth.

🔲 7. Transitions & Interactions

Add smooth transitions (200–300ms) for hover scaling, border glow, and icon brightness.

Cursor should change to pointer on hover over each card.

🔲 8. Accessibility

Ensure high color contrast ratios for readability.

Make cards accessible via keyboard navigation (tab index) for inclusivity.

💻 Implementation Notes
Use React functional components and standard CSS or CSS modules.

Organize cards in a RoleplayEventCard component with props (icon, title, promptCount).

Use CSS grid for layout with grid-template-columns set for responsiveness.
